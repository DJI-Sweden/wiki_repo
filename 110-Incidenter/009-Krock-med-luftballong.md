An unfortunate and unnecessarily epic encounter between a DJI Mavic Pro (piloted by someone who was unaware that he was "piloting" anything more than a toy), and an enormous bag of hot air.

RIP drone.

The remorseful letter by the drone pilot is a pretty good read, by the way. One highlight: "I never thought it would be difficult to avoid an 8-story slow-moving balloon."
